	<p class="song lyrics">
		At the 50 yard line, I saw her feet
		She was under the bleachers, waiting for me
		No, I never get high, but I'm smoking her weed
		She been giving this freshman love since last June
		The only senior girl with tattoos
		Said nobody can find out things that we do
		She said, "Put your hands behind your head
		Let me blow your mind, kid, but don't get too excited"
		You can call me "Stacy, " you can call me "Love"
		You can call me "Baby" and all of the above
		You can call me late night and I'll be at your door
		You can call me anything, oh, anything you want
		Just don't call me yours
		It's 3:05 on a Friday, bell rings
		Her parents left last night for Palm Springs
		She's got the whole house empty for me
		My brother, he needed the car, so I ran
		Down 71st as fast as I can
		I'm telling her everything I had planned
		She said, "I know we've been getting close
		We can't get no closer, you'll get it when you're older"
		You can call me "Stacy, " you can call me "Love"
		You can call me "Baby" and all of the above
		You can call me late night and I'll be at your door
		You can call me anything, oh, anything you want
		Just don't call me yours
		Just don't call me yours
		You can call me "Stacy, " you can call me "Love"
		You can call me "Baby" and all of the above
		You can call me late night and I'll be at your door
		You can call me anything, oh, anything you want
		Just don't call me yours
		I'm over you, I'm over you
		I'm over you, I'm over you

		Didn't even wanna go out, why'd you call me?
	I've had a long day and still got laundry
	Two, three, four, make me drink more
	Then you walk through the door
	All my friends are buying blow in the bathroom
	There's people climbing up the wall 'cause it's a packed house
	"Who are you? What's your name?" I ask
	Surprised she answered fast
	I think there's too many random bodies dancing near us
	If three's a crowd, what would you call this?
	Yeah
	We should go somewhere
	You choose, I don't care
	As long as you're right here
	Stay next to me
	Yeah
	We can barely stand
	And we both don't know this band
	I'll move, just hold my hand
	Stay next to me
	The cigarettes and the burn of your whiskey
	I can taste on my tongue when you kiss me
	Down your drink faster than me
	You ask if you can see
	My bedroom and the place that I grew up
	My life goals and the times that I threw up
	Said you're down to take a ride
	So let's grab a cab in five
	I think there's too many random bodies dancing near us
	If three's a crowd, what would you call this?
	Yeah
	We should go somewhere
	You choose, I don't care
	As long as you're right here
	Stay next to me
	Yeah
	We can barely stand
	And we both don't know this band
	I'll move, just hold my hand
	Stay next to me
	Time is standing still
	Throw a couple twenties on the bill
	I can't waste another second here, how 'bout you?
	We're turning down your street
	And you've got your hands all over me
	There's no place on earth I'd rather be than with you (with you, yeah)
	Yeah
	We should go somewhere
	You choose, I don't care
	As long as you're right here
	Stay next to me
	Yeah
	We can barely stand
	And we both don't know this band
	I'll move, just hold my hand
	Stay next to me
	Yeah
	We should go somewhere (we should go somewhere)
	You choose, I don't care (don't care)
	As long as you're right here (as long as you're right here)
	Stay next to me (next to me)
	Yeah (yeah)
	We can barely stand
	And we both don't know this band
	I'll move, just hold my hand
	Stay next to me

	<p class="song lyrics">
		I'm in shambles since I blew my 16th candle
		It's the little things that I can't handle
		And we're still in July
		Call me or reach me 'cause I need samples
		A newspapes with no more scandals
		Some loose change with no more vandals
		Can I get up out my mind?
		And yeah, I know my world's burning down
		Where to run? Who to call?
		Even though my world's burning down
		I know I can get through the fall
		'Cause life must go on (go, go on)
		One blink, then it's all gone
		I said life must go on (go, go on)
		Even when you know it's all wrong
		Whether you're high, whether you're low
		Gotta keep on, be a part of the show
		I said life must go on (go, go on)
		Go on, and you know I got you
		In my mind, in the chemistry that I combine sits
		A melody that's singing, "You're not fine"
		But they can't hear me out
		So I'm in a rapid conversation
		To know if this is any normal sensation
		The internet's saying I'm temptatious
		And they can't hear me shout
		And yeah, I know my world's burning down
		Where to run? Who to call?
		Even though my world's burning down
		I know I can get through the fall
		'Cause life must go on (go, go on)
		One blink, then it's all gone
		I said life must go on (go, go on)
		Even when you know it's all wrong
		Whether you're high, whether you're low
		Gotta keep on, be a part of the show
		I said life must go on (go, go on)
		Go on, and you know I got you
		Everything keeps on changing and I'm caught in the middle
		I just keep getting anxious, yeah, I'm caught in the middle
		Trouble turning these pages, yeah, I'm caught in the middle
		Life must go on
		One blink, then it's all gone
		I said life must go on
		Even when you know it's all wrong
		Whether you're high, whether you're low
		Gotta keep on, be a part of the show
		I said life must go on (yeah)
		Go on, and you know I got you
		Life must go on (life goes on)
		One blink, then it's all gone (all gone)
		I said life must go on (go on)
		Even when you know it's all wrong
		So whether you're high, whether you're low
		Gotta keep on, be a part of the show
		I said life must go on (life goes on)
		Go on, and you know I got you
		Whether you're high, whether you're low
		Gotta keep on, be a part of the show
		I said life must go on
		Go on, and you know I got you</p>

	<p class="song lyrics">
		Why am I obsessed with
		Self-destructiveness?
		Say "I need you less"
		Cycle through refresh
		And feel a loneliness
		Seems I'll never learn
		Matches on a table
		Striking every angle
		Recognise the past tense
		Knowing nothing's stable
		If you didn't show me
		The light is moving slowly
		Having trouble coping
		With the fire in your stare
		All I see cloudy smoke above me
		And you keep saying
		Its lovely
		But I, but I
		Find myself kneeling
		From all these caving ceilings
		Yeah, something seems
		Appealing to me, to me
		Why am I obsessed with
		Self-destructiveness?
		Say "I need you less"
		Cycle through refresh
		And feel a loneliness
		Seems I'll never learn
		That bridges always burn
		I can't wipe the stains off
		Wake up from the same [?]
		We're heeded by this moment
		Still trying to tear me off
		Doors are always closing
		I feel myself eroding
		It's raining every morning
		But I haven't had enough
		All I see cloudy smoke above me
		And you keep saying its lovely
		But I, but I
		Find myself kneeling from
		All these caving ceilings
		Yeah, something seems
		Appealing to me, to me
		Why am I obsessed with
		Self-destructiveness?
		Say "I need you less"
		Cycle through refresh
		And feel a loneliness
		Seems I'll never learn
		That bridges always burn
		Bridges always burn
		All I see cloudy smoke above me
		And you keep saying its lovely
		But I, but I
		Bridges always burn
		Find myself kneeling from
		All these caving ceilings
		Yeah, something seems appealing to me

	<p class="song lyrics">
		Focus on you in the light, it helps me fill my emotions
		Why are we at such a distance?
		Find ourselves so out of frame
		This love stay calm in the night,
		Yeah, help me heal and re-open
		Why are we drifting away from everything we wanted to save?
		I told you I'd be down forever
		Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
		It's old news, I should look for better
		Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
		Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
		Still I dial those numbers every time
		Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
		Slowly wishing you were never mine
		Your face became all I know, I'd try to picture another
		Why are we frayed at the edge, it's making me feel all to blame
		I wanna know what's the deal
		Where have you been and what do you think of me?
		Is it a new girl silently screaming your name?
		I told you I'd be down forever
		Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
		It's old news, I should look for better
		Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
		You leave me hanging on
		Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
		Still I dial those numbers every time
		Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
		Slowly wishing you were never mine
		I told you I'd be down forever
		Loving you is danger, but it don't feel wrong
		It's old news, I should look for better
		Falling back to strangers, leave me hanging on
		See, I don't know better than to give up on loving
		Why am I still holding on? I'm still holding on
		And I'm way too honest and you make me want it
		Lying alone al night long, alone all night along
		Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
		Still I dial those numbers every time
		Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
		Slowly wishing you were never mine
		Flare guns go off in my head, saying not to call you this late
		Still I dial those numbers every time
		(Still I dial those numbers every time)
		Why do I replay those messages that you left at the tone last May?
		Slowly wishing you were never mine
		(Slowly wishing you were never mine)
