    <h1>Gardens of Babur Kabul</h1>

    This platform I chose
    <a href="https://twitter.com/baburof?s=21">Twitter</a> to represent my ideas
    <br />
    I chose this platform from Aria's point of view so it would be like her
    tweeting<br />
    throughout the day of what inspires her and what made her write the poem she
    did<br />
    so for each line of the poem she wrote would be the caption.<br />
    For each picture I picked a key word from each stanza and I searched it
    through<br />
    Twitter and picked a few of the top pictures I thought that was
    appropriate<br /><br />
