    <h1> P1: Cross-Platform Storytelling </h1>
    <p>
    <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/fE7EyNdT1UN5oyj1A"> Screenshots from Snapchat</a><br>
    For this one I chose to make it on the platform of snapchat where the photos taken <br>
    correspond with the context of each caption. I decided to uswe my own pictures<br>
    because the beauty of snapchat is to take the picture in the moment so I took those<br>
    photos with the mindset that I am Aria Aber, the author.

    For this one I chose the platform instagram posting as Aria Aber as the same concept of that<br>
    it is going to be that the photos will connect with the line from the poem (caption). For my <br>
    photo option I looked up a key word from a line from the poem on instagram and picked what I <br>
    thought suited the caption best.

    Lastly for this one I chose twitter as my platfrom and made the account as Aria Aber and<br>
    tweeted with the same concept as what I did for Instagram. <br>
