    <h1>Instagram</h1>

    <p>
      This platform I chose
      <a href="https://instagram.com/gardens_of_babur_kabul?igshid=wbnwiybcurbr"
        >Instagram</a
      >
      to represent my ideas.
      <br />
      I wanted this to be told from Aria's point of view as if he was posting
      the things <br />
      where each line of his poem was inspired form something he saw and posted
      on instagram.<br />
      Each picture I used was searched through the instagram search hashtags and
      I picked my favorite.
