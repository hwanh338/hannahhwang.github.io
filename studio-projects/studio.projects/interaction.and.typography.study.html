    <p> With a partner: <br>
1. Find 5 examples of interesting/confusing/distinct interactions on the web <br>
    A. <a href="http://hoverstat.es/" ></a> I was confused on which links were meant to be hovered over until<br>
        I actually did and some change was made or something popped up<br><br>
    B. <a href="http://hoverstat.es/" ></a> I found it interesting how some features highlighted when I hovered<br>
        over it so it was easier to read. <br><br>
    C. <a href="https://newdawn.digital/" ></a> I found this virtual interaction is very interesting and the <br>
        overall website is very organized. <br><br>
    D.<a href=" https://ezekielaquino.com/" ></a> I think the texture and pattern created with the music <br>
        is interesting but I was confused on what the purpose of it was. <br><br>
    E. <a href="http://hallointer.net/worldonawire" ></a> I did not like this one at all I found it very <br>
        confusing because there were so many things going on as well as nothing would actually <br>
        indicated that it is being hovered over other than the fact that my mouse goes from just <br>
        a pointer to the clicker hand thing. <br><br>

2. Find 5 examples of interesting/ugly/beautiful typography on the web <br>
    A. <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" ></a> I found the font GT Alpina Typewriter, Lausanne very interesting<br><br>
    B. <a href="http://www.gabischirrmacher.de/" ></a> I think the simple design of the website works nicely with <br>
        the sans serif typeface.<br><br>
    C. <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" ></a> I like the the bubblyness of the Sometimes Times, FF Bau, DM Mono <br>
        font and how clean it looks <br><br>
    D. <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" ></a> I really disliked the Whyte, Media Sans font because it looked like <br><br>
        it was printed poorly or something was wrong with the font because glimpses of it were cut out. <br>
    E. <a href="http://juliavolkmar.de/" ></a> I like how the type is arranged in the website, almost like it is placed <br><br>
        on top of the box.<br><br>
