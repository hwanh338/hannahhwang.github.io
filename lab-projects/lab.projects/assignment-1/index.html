      Lisette's top three most used categories were social, entertainment and
      finance. She used social mostly for message, twitter, and instagram.
      <br />
      For entertainment Netflix was the number one she used because she loved to
      watch movies and t.v. shows. For the finance category it was <br />
      for keeping up with her doctors appointmemt.
